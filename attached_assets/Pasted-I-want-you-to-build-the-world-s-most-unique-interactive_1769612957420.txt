I want you to build the world’s most unique, interactive, production-quality QA Engineer portfolio for Arisha Mumtaz, specifically showcasing manual QA, AI in testing, performance testing, and automation learning, in a way that no other QA portfolio exists like this. This portfolio must set her apart globally.

The portfolio should feel like a QA testing environment + AI-powered workflow, not just a static portfolio.

🌟 KEY DIFFERENTIATORS (MAKE THEM PROMINENT)

Interactive QA Playground

Users can simulate testing of UI components:

Buttons, forms, themes, responsiveness

Shows PASS/FAIL feedback in real time

Micro-interactions emulate real QA tools

AI Testing Showcase

Highlight tools Arisha uses:

ChatGPT / Gemini → AI test case generation

Test Craft / Test Rigor → AI test automation

Interactive cards showing tool, purpose, and demo workflow

Manual QA Expertise

Tools like Test Case Studio (bug recording)

Workflow visualization (diagram / timeline):

Understand requirements

Write test cases

Execute tests

Record bugs

Measure performance

Generate AI-assisted tests

Report results

Performance & Accessibility Observatory

Real-time display of:

Lighthouse scores (Perf, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)

Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS)

Accessibility check summary

Include screenshots or graphs of test runs

Video Workflow Explanation

Embed a 1–2 minute video Arisha will make

Section title: “My QA Workflow Explained”

Explain how she uses manual + AI tools interactively

Placeholder should be elegant with “Video coming soon…”

Automation Learning Journey

Show Arisha’s Selenium in Python journey

Interactive timeline showing growth:

Manual → AI → Automation

Include “practice exercises” or sample automation logs

Case Studies with AI & Manual Storytelling

For 2–3 sample projects:

What was tested manually

How AI helped generate test cases

Performance & accessibility gains

Bugs found / prevented

Screenshots, metrics, or logs

Tools & Extensions Hub

Categorized cards:
